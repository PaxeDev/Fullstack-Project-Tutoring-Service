Tutoring System
Description

The goal of this project is to showcase my skills after completing the backend web development course.
It is a tutoring system where university students can quickly and easily create an account with an email and password to see the available tutoring sessions for the subjects they are interested in.
Technologies and Tools

    Backend: PHP
    Database: MySQL
    Frontend: JavaScript (AJAX) and CSS
    
Installation and Setup

To replicate the project, users will need to create their own files:

    fileUpload.php (for registration and profile changes)
    dbconnection.php (which includes the database connection and the CRUD class in OOP)
    headers.php (for AJAX functionality)

Basic Usage

There are pre-created sessions in the database for admin, trainer, and user.
Key Features

    Admin: Full control over user profiles, allowing editing and deletion. Also manages tutoring offers: create, modify, delete, and view.
    Users: Can filter tutoring sessions by subject, access a list of available sessions, and leave ratings for tutoring sessions after they are completed.
